# ReverseMaybe
This is hopefully where I want to put basics things we should know when doing basic malware analysis.
With hope, I would be adding to this repo once per week. Together with an example sample that will be used in the explanation.

Some basic I would like to hopefully cover is

1. Powershell
2. Python
3. Java
4. Javascript
5. C#
6. APK
7. Godot
8. LNKs

Languages that I would need to learn first before diving deep for malware reverse stuff
1. C 
2. C++
3. Golang
4. Nim
5. Rust
6. DLLs (In C, and C# formats)
7. .SCR files
